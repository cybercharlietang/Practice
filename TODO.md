# Training Plan

## Overview
- **Total Time Budget**: 40-50 hours
- **Session Formats**: Problem sets (≤1hr), Mock interviews (1hr), Assessments (90min)
- **Approach**: Cover all topics systematically, assess after each, then mock tests

---

## Phase 1: Problem Sets (Concept Building)

### PS-01: String Manipulation ✓ (2026-01-30, 1.5 hrs)
- [x] Reverse words in a sentence
- [x] Check palindrome (ignore case/spaces)
- [x] Count vowels/consonants
- [x] Interleave two strings
- [x] Compress string ("aabbb" → "a2b3")

### PS-02: Array Fundamentals ✓ (2026-01-30, 45 min)
- [x] Remove duplicates (preserve order)
- [x] Rotate array by k positions
- [x] Find missing number in 1..n
- [x] Merge two sorted arrays
- [x] Move zeros to end

### PS-03: Hash Tables & Counting ✓ (2026-01-30, 45 min)
- [x] Two sum (return indices)
- [x] Group anagrams
- [x] First unique character
- [x] Most frequent element
- [x] Check if two strings are anagrams

### PS-04: Sliding Window ✓ (2026-01-30, 90 min)
- [x] Maximum sum of k consecutive elements
- [x] Longest substring without repeating chars
- [x] Minimum window substring (simplified)
- [x] Count subarrays with sum = k
- [x] Sliding window maximum (using deque)

### PS-05: Data Structures (Revised)
- [ ] Stack operations (validate parentheses, min stack)
- [ ] Queue operations (implement with stacks, circular queue)
- [ ] Linked list basics (reverse, detect cycle)
- [ ] Sorted set with bisect (insertion, range queries)
- [ ] Class design: RangeCounter

### PS-06: Class Design (Q3 Simulation)
- [ ] Simple Counter class with statistics
- [ ] LRU Cache (simplified)
- [ ] Rate Limiter
- [ ] Todo Manager with priorities
- [ ] Event Scheduler with conflicts

### ~~PS-07 to PS-10: SKIPPED~~
*Binary search, heaps, intervals, graphs — not needed for ICA*

## Phase 2: Mock Assessments (Timed)

| # | Title | Focus | Status |
|---|-------|-------|--------|
| ICA-001 | Integer Container | Warm-up, environment familiarity | Available |
| ICA-002 | TBD | Q3-style progressive class | Pending |
| ICA-003 | TBD | Full 4-level simulation | Pending |
| ICA-004 | TBD | Full 4-level simulation | Pending |

---

## Progress Tracking

### Current Phase: Phase 1 (Problem Sets)
- [x] Complete PS-01 to establish baseline
- [x] Assess timing and accuracy
- [ ] Adjust difficulty based on results

### Completion Criteria
- Problem sets: 80%+ first-try accuracy, reasonable speed
- Mock assessments: Complete L1-L3 within 60 min, L4 attempted

## Session Log
| Date | Activity | Duration | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| 2026-01-30 | PS-01 Strings | 1.5 hrs | 28/28 passed, difficulty "about right", speed needs work |
| 2026-01-30 | PS-02 Arrays | 45 min | 32/32 passed, hit target time, review mutation vs copy |
| 2026-01-30 | PS-03 Hash Tables | 45 min | 27/27 passed, learned Counter/defaultdict |
| 2026-01-30 | PS-04 Sliding Window | 90 min | 30/30 passed, solutions correct but suboptimal complexity |
