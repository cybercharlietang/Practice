# Training Plan

## Overview
- **Total Time Budget**: 40-50 hours
- **Session Formats**: Problem sets (≤1hr), Mock interviews (1hr), Assessments (90min)
- **Approach**: Cover all topics systematically, assess after each, then mock tests

---

## Phase 1: Problem Sets (Concept Building)

### PS-01: String Manipulation
- [ ] Reverse words in a sentence
- [ ] Check palindrome (ignore case/spaces)
- [ ] Count vowels/consonants
- [ ] Interleave two strings
- [ ] Compress string ("aabbb" → "a2b3")

### PS-02: Array Fundamentals
- [ ] Remove duplicates (preserve order)
- [ ] Rotate array by k positions
- [ ] Find missing number in 1..n
- [ ] Merge two sorted arrays
- [ ] Move zeros to end

### PS-03: Hash Tables & Counting
- [ ] Two sum (return indices)
- [ ] Group anagrams
- [ ] First unique character
- [ ] Most frequent element
- [ ] Check if two strings are anagrams

### PS-04: Sliding Window
- [ ] Maximum sum of k consecutive elements
- [ ] Longest substring without repeating chars
- [ ] Minimum window substring (simplified)
- [ ] Count subarrays with sum = k
- [ ] Sliding window maximum (using deque)

### PS-05: Two Pointer
- [ ] Valid palindrome with alphanumeric only
- [ ] Container with most water (simplified)
- [ ] Remove duplicates from sorted array (in-place)
- [ ] Three sum (find triplets summing to zero)
- [ ] Merge intervals

### PS-06: Heaps
- [ ] Kth largest element in array
- [ ] Kth largest in stream
- [ ] Merge k sorted lists
- [ ] Top k frequent elements
- [ ] Streaming median (two heaps)

### PS-07: Sorting & Binary Search
- [ ] Custom sort by frequency
- [ ] Sort by multiple criteria (stable)
- [ ] Binary search insert position
- [ ] Search in rotated sorted array
- [ ] Find peak element

### PS-08: Intervals
- [ ] Merge overlapping intervals
- [ ] Insert interval
- [ ] Check if intervals overlap
- [ ] Meeting rooms (can attend all?)
- [ ] Meeting rooms II (min rooms needed)

### PS-09: Class Design (Q3 Simulation)
- [ ] Simple Counter class with statistics
- [ ] LRU Cache (simplified)
- [ ] Rate Limiter
- [ ] Todo Manager with priorities
- [ ] Event Scheduler with conflicts

### PS-10: Graph Basics (Optional for ICA)
- [ ] BFS shortest path in grid
- [ ] DFS connected components
- [ ] Detect cycle in directed graph
- [ ] Topological sort

## Phase 2: Mock Assessments (Timed)

| # | Title | Focus | Status |
|---|-------|-------|--------|
| ICA-001 | Integer Container | Warm-up, environment familiarity | Available |
| ICA-002 | TBD | Q3-style progressive class | Pending |
| ICA-003 | TBD | Full 4-level simulation | Pending |
| ICA-004 | TBD | Full 4-level simulation | Pending |

## Progress Tracking

### Current Phase: Setup
- [ ] Complete PS-01 to establish baseline
- [ ] Assess timing and accuracy
- [ ] Adjust difficulty based on results

### Completion Criteria
- Problem sets: 80%+ first-try accuracy, reasonable speed
- Mock assessments: Complete L1-L3 within 60 min, L4 attempted
